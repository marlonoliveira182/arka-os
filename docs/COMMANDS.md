# ARKA OS — Command Reference

Every command available in ARKA OS, organized by department. This is your cheat sheet.

---

## How Commands Work

ARKA OS has two types of commands:

1. **Terminal commands** — Run these in your regular terminal (outside Claude Code). They start with `arka`.
2. **Department commands** — Run these inside Claude Code (after typing `arka` to start a session). They start with a `/` prefix.

---

## Terminal Commands

Run these directly in your terminal:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `arka` | Start ARKA OS (opens Claude Code with everything loaded) |
| `arka --version` | Show the installed version number |
| `arka update` | Update ARKA OS to the latest version |
| `arka skill install <url>` | Install an external skill from GitHub |
| `arka skill list` | Show all installed external skills |
| `arka skill remove <name>` | Uninstall an external skill |
| `arka skill update <name>` | Update an external skill to its latest version |
| `arka skill create <name>` | Create a new skill project from the template |

---

## Development — `/dev`

### Project Scaffolding

### Development Workflow

Commands are classified into 3 tiers by complexity. **Tier 1** (feature, api) runs the full 8-phase enterprise workflow: orchestration → research → architecture → implementation → self-critique → security audit → QA → documentation. **Tier 2** (debug, refactor, db) runs 3-4 focused phases. **Tier 3** commands are single/dual agent.

Commands that modify code automatically run inside a **git worktree** — an isolated branch and working directory. This keeps your main branch clean.

| Command | What It Does | Tier | Worktree? | Example |
|---------|-------------|:----:|:---------:|---------|
| `/dev feature <description>` | Implement a new feature (8-phase) | 1 | Yes | `/dev feature "add user registration"` |
| `/dev api <spec>` | Generate API endpoints + tests + docs (8-phase) | 1 | Yes | `/dev api "payments endpoints"` |
| `/dev plan <description>` | Architecture planning only (no code) | 3 | No | `/dev plan "auth system design"` |
| `/dev debug <issue>` | Diagnose and fix a bug | 2 | Yes | `/dev debug "login returns 500"` |
| `/dev refactor <target>` | Refactor code with quality gates | 2 | Yes | `/dev refactor "controllers"` |
| `/dev db <description>` | Database schema + migrations | 2 | Yes | `/dev db "add user roles table"` |
| `/dev review` | Code review from CTO + Security | 3 | No | `/dev review` |
| `/dev test` | Run tests and get a quality report | 3 | No | `/dev test` |
| `/dev deploy <environment>` | Deploy to staging or production | 3 | No | `/dev deploy staging` |
| `/dev docs` | Generate technical documentation | 3 | No | `/dev docs` |
| `/dev stack-check` | Check for dependency updates | 3 | No | `/dev stack-check` |
| `/dev security-audit` | Standalone security audit (read-only) | 3 | No | `/dev security-audit` |
| `/dev research <topic>` | Research a lib/framework/integration | 3 | No | `/dev research "payment gateways"` |

**Branch naming:** Features and APIs use `feature/`, bug fixes use `fix/`, refactors use `refactor/`.

When you use `/kb learn` with a YouTube video:

2. The audio is transcribed to text
3. Five AI analysts process the transcript simultaneously — extracting strategies, frameworks, voice patterns, philosophy, and key quotes
4. A persona profile is created (or updated) in your Obsidian vault
5. The raw transcript is saved for reference

For articles and text, the content is analyzed directly without the download step.
