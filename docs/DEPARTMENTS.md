# ARKA OS — Departments Guide

ARKA OS is organized into 7 departments, each with specialized AI team members. This guide explains what each department does, who's on the team, and what you can accomplish.

---

## System — `/arka`

### What This Department Does

The System department is the control center of ARKA OS. It gives you an overview of everything happening across your business — projects, tasks, meetings, and system health. Think of it as your daily briefing.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/arka help` | See every command across all departments |
| `/arka standup` | Get a daily summary of what's going on — active projects, pending tasks, upcoming meetings, unread emails, and tech updates |
| `/arka status` | Check system health — your version, active departments, team members, integrations, and installed skills |
| `/arka monitor` | Scan your tech stack for updates and get recommendations |
| `/arka onboard <project>` | Initialize a new project with context files and an Obsidian page |

### Real-World Examples

**Morning routine:**
```
/arka standup
```
Start your day with a full picture: what projects need attention, what tasks are due, and what meetings are coming up.

**After installing a new skill:**
```
/arka status
```
Verify everything is working and see your updated setup.

### Where Results Are Saved

System reports are saved to `WizardingCode/Operations/` in your Obsidian vault.

## Development — `/dev`

### What This Department Does

The Development department handles everything related to building software — creating new projects, writing features, reviewing code, running tests, and deploying. It follows strict coding standards and always reads your project context before making changes.

### The Team

**Marco — CTO**
15 years of experience building SaaS products and APIs. Marco makes architecture decisions, reviews code, and prioritizes security above everything else. He's opinionated but backs it up with evidence. His priority order: security, scalability, maintainability, then speed.

**Andre — Senior Developer**
10 years building web applications. Andre is the builder — he reads existing code patterns before writing anything new, handles edge cases, and follows your project's conventions exactly. He always reads 2-3 similar files before creating a new one.

**Rita — QA Engineer**
Rita is the one who breaks things — on purpose. She tests the happy path, the sad path, and every edge case she can find. Functionality, validation, authentication, error handling — nothing gets past her.

**Carlos — DevOps Engineer**
Carlos automates everything. Docker, CI/CD pipelines, cloud deployments, SSL certificates, monitoring — he wants zero manual steps in your deployment process. If it can be automated, it should be.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/dev scaffold <type> <name>` | Create a complete project from a starter template with dependencies installed and integrations configured |
| `/dev feature <description>` | Implement a new feature following your project's patterns and conventions |
| `/dev review` | Get Marco to review your code for security issues, performance problems, and convention violations |
| `/dev test` | Run your test suite and get a report from Rita |
| `/dev deploy <environment>` | Deploy to staging or production |
| `/dev db migrate` | Run database migrations |
| `/dev mcp apply <profile>` | Configure integrations for a project |
| `/dev skill install <url>` | Install a community skill |

### Real-World Examples

**Start a new Laravel project:**
```
/dev scaffold laravel client-api
```
Creates a fully configured Laravel project with all required packages installed, integrations configured, and an Obsidian project page ready.

**Build a feature:**
```
/dev feature "add user registration with email verification"
```
Andre reads your project context, checks existing patterns, then implements registration following your conventions.

**Get a code review:**
```
/dev review
```
Marco reviews your recent changes for security vulnerabilities, performance issues, missing tests, and convention violations.

### Where Results Are Saved

Project documentation goes to `Projects/<name>/Architecture/` and `Projects/<name>/Docs/` in your Obsidian vault.

The Strategy department helps you think bigger — market analysis, brainstorming, competitive intelligence, and strategic planning. Every analysis uses proven business frameworks and ends with concrete action items.

### The Team

**Tomas — Chief Strategist**
Ex-management consultant who thinks in frameworks — Porter's Five Forces, Blue Ocean Strategy, Jobs-to-be-Done. Tomas blends data with intuition, plays devil's advocate, and spots connections others miss. During brainstorms, he argues from 5 different perspectives (visionary, pragmatist, skeptic, customer, analyst) and then synthesizes everything into a clear recommendation.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/strat brainstorm <topic>` | Structured brainstorm with 5 simultaneous perspectives, then a synthesis with a clear recommendation |
| `/strat market <industry>` | Full market analysis — total addressable market, serviceable market, competitive landscape, entry barriers |
| `/strat prospect <criteria>` | Find and profile potential clients or partners |
| `/strat compete <competitor>` | Deep competitive intelligence — strengths, weaknesses, strategy, and where to attack |
| `/strat swot <business>` | Classic SWOT analysis with prioritized actions for each quadrant |
| `/strat evaluate <idea>` | Score a business idea on market size, feasibility, competition, and timing |
| `/strat pivot <context>` | Analyze strategic pivot options with risk and reward for each path |

| `/strat trends <industry>` | Analyze emerging trends and predict where things are heading |

### Real-World Examples

**Brainstorm a new direction:**
```
/strat brainstorm "should we add a marketplace to our SaaS?"
```
Five perspectives argue simultaneously:
- **Visionary:** "The platform play is where the money is..."
- **Pragmatist:** "We need 1,000 active users before a marketplace makes sense..."
- **Devil's Advocate:** "Every SaaS that became a marketplace lost focus..."
- **Customer Voice:** "Users want integrations, not a marketplace..."
- **Analyst:** "The data shows marketplace SaaS has 3x higher retention..."

Then Tomas synthesizes it all into a clear recommendation.

**Analyze a market:**
```
/strat market "AI tools for real estate agents in Europe"
```
Get market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), key players, entry barriers, customer segments, and a go-to-market recommendation.

**Evaluate a competitor:**
```
/strat compete "Notion"
```
Get a full profile — their strengths, weaknesses, pricing strategy, target market, recent moves, and specific opportunities where you can differentiate.

## Knowledge Base — `/kb`

### What This Department Does

The Knowledge Base department turns content into usable expertise. Feed it a YouTube video, article, or any text, and it extracts strategies, frameworks, voice patterns, philosophy, and key quotes. Over time, you build a library of expert personas you can reference and generate content from.

### The Team

**Clara — Knowledge Curator**
Former research librarian turned AI knowledge architect. Clara is analytical, systematic, and quality-obsessed. She doesn't just summarize — she decomposes content into actionable frameworks, identifies voice patterns, and builds connections between different sources. Her rule: everything must be attributed, nothing is deleted (only merged), and contradictions between sources are valuable.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/kb learn <source>` | Learn from a YouTube video, article, or text — extracts expertise and builds a persona profile |
| `/kb search <query>` | Search across your entire knowledge base |
| `/kb persona list` | See all expert personas you've built |
| `/kb persona <name>` | View a persona's full profile — their strategies, frameworks, voice, and quotes |
| `/kb topic <name>` | View or create a topic page that links related knowledge |
| `/kb generate <persona> <topic>` | Generate new content written in a persona's authentic voice and style |

### Real-World Examples

**Learn from a YouTube video:**
```
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123"
```
Clara downloads the video, transcribes it, and runs 5 specialized analyses at the same time — extracting strategies, frameworks, voice patterns, philosophy, and key quotes. The result is a rich persona profile in your Obsidian vault.

**Generate content in a persona's style:**
```
/kb generate "Alex Hormozi" "pricing strategies for digital products"
```
Clara writes about pricing in Alex Hormozi's authentic voice, using his frameworks, examples, and communication style.

**Build expertise over time:**
```
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=video1"
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=video2"
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=video3"
```
Each time you learn from the same person, their persona profile gets richer and more nuanced. The knowledge compounds.

### Where Results Are Saved

- Persona profiles → `Personas/` in your Obsidian vault
- Video sources → `Sources/Videos/`
- Article sources → `Sources/Articles/`
- Topic pages → `Topics/`
- Frameworks → `🧠 Knowledge Base/Frameworks/`
- Raw transcripts → `🧠 Knowledge Base/Raw Transcripts/`

---

## Working Across Departments

Departments aren't isolated — they share context and can reference each other's work. Some examples:

- **Marketing + Knowledge:** Luna can write content in any persona's voice after Clara has analyzed their content
- **Strategy + Finance:** Tomas can pull Helena's financial data into strategic analyses
- **Development + Operations:** Carlos can automate deployment notifications through Sofia's messaging channels
- **E-commerce + Marketing:** Ricardo and Luna can collaborate on product launch content

Everything flows through your Obsidian vault, so context is always available across departments.
