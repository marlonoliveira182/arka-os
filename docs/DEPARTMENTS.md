# ARKA OS — Departments Guide

ARKA OS is organized into 7 departments, each with specialized AI team members. This guide explains what each department does, who's on the team, and what you can accomplish.

---

## System — `/arka`

### What This Department Does

The System department is the control center of ARKA OS. It gives you an overview of everything happening across your business — projects, tasks, meetings, and system health. Think of it as your daily briefing.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/arka help` | See every command across all departments |
| `/arka standup` | Get a daily summary of what's going on — active projects, pending tasks, upcoming meetings, unread emails, and tech updates |
| `/arka status` | Check system health — your version, active departments, team members, integrations, and installed skills |
| `/arka monitor` | Scan your tech stack for updates and get recommendations |
| `/arka onboard <project>` | Initialize a new project with context files and an Obsidian page |

### Real-World Examples

**Morning routine:**
```
/arka standup
```
Start your day with a full picture: what projects need attention, what tasks are due, and what meetings are coming up.

**After installing a new skill:**
```
/arka status
```
Verify everything is working and see your updated setup.

### Where Results Are Saved

System reports are saved to `WizardingCode/Operations/` in your Obsidian vault.

## Development — `/dev`

### What This Department Does

The Development department is an enterprise-grade team of 9 specialized agents that handles everything related to building software — planning architecture, researching libraries, creating projects, writing features with mandatory security audits and self-critique, reviewing code, running tests, and deploying. It follows a structured multi-phase workflow with TODO tracking and always reads your project context before making changes.

### The Team

**Marco — CTO**
15 years of experience building SaaS products and APIs. Marco is the final technical authority — he makes architecture decisions, reviews code, and has veto power on any design. His priority order: security, scalability, maintainability, then speed.

**Paulo — Tech Lead (Orchestrator)**
12 years leading engineering teams. Paulo doesn't write code — he orchestrates. He creates TODO lists before any work begins, manages workflow phases, coordinates the team, and writes final reports. Nothing starts without Paulo's plan.

**Gabriel — Software Architect**
12 years designing systems. Gabriel designs before anyone builds — data flows, API contracts, component hierarchies, schema changes. He writes Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to Obsidian and gets Marco's approval before implementation starts.

**Andre — Senior Backend Developer**
10 years building web applications. Andre is the backend builder — Laravel, PHP, PostgreSQL, API design. He reads existing code patterns before writing anything new, follows the implementation order (Migration → Model → Service → Controller → FormRequest → Resource → Routes), and always reads 2-3 similar files first.

**Diana — Senior Frontend Developer**
8 years building user interfaces. Diana handles Vue 3, Nuxt 3, React, and Next.js. She thinks in components, demands pixel-perfect UIs, and never ships without loading states, error states, empty states, and accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav).

**Bruno — Security Engineer**
10 years in application security. Bruno runs OWASP Top 10 checks on every feature before it ships. He's professionally paranoid — every input is malicious until proven otherwise. Critical issues block shipping, period.

**Rita — QA Lead**
Rita breaks things — on purpose — and defines the quality bar. She designs test strategies, writes feature/unit/component tests, enforces quality gates (≥80% coverage, all tests green), and blocks shipping when criteria aren't met.

**Carlos — DevOps Lead**
9 years automating infrastructure. Carlos handles CI/CD pipelines, Docker, zero-downtime deployments, monitoring (Sentry), and environment management. If it can be automated, it will be.

**Lucas — Technical Analyst**
7 years in technical research. Lucas fetches up-to-date framework docs via Context7 MCP, searches the Obsidian KB for existing patterns, evaluates libraries, and documents everything. Every development session starts with his research.

### Enterprise Workflow

Features and APIs follow an 8-phase enterprise workflow:

1. **Orchestration** — Paulo creates TODO list, enters worktree, detects stack
2. **Research** — Lucas fetches docs (Context7), searches KB, checks codebase
3. **Architecture** — Gabriel designs, writes ADR. Marco reviews and approves.
4. **Implementation** — Andre (backend) + Diana (frontend) build in parallel
5. **Self-Critique** — Each developer reviews their own work against checklists
6. **Security Audit** — Bruno runs OWASP Top 10 against new code
7. **QA** — Rita writes tests, runs suite, enforces quality gate
8. **Documentation** — Lucas saves patterns to KB, Paulo writes final report

Simpler commands (debug, refactor, db) use a focused 3-4 phase workflow. Read-only commands (review, test, deploy, docs, research) use 1-2 phases.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/dev scaffold <type> <name>` | Create a complete project from a starter template with dependencies installed and integrations configured |
| `/dev feature <description>` | Implement a new feature with full 8-phase enterprise workflow |
| `/dev api <spec>` | Generate API endpoints with full 8-phase enterprise workflow |
| `/dev plan <description>` | Architecture planning only — Gabriel designs, no code changes |
| `/dev debug <issue>` | Diagnose and fix a bug with triage, fix, and regression test |
| `/dev refactor <target>` | Refactor code with quality gates — tests must pass before and after |
| `/dev review` | Code review from Marco (CTO) + Bruno (Security) |
| `/dev test` | Run your test suite and get a quality report from Rita |
| `/dev deploy <environment>` | Deploy to staging or production |
| `/dev db <description>` | Create database migrations and update models |
| `/dev docs` | Generate technical documentation |
| `/dev stack-check` | Check for dependency updates |
| `/dev security-audit` | Standalone OWASP security audit of your codebase |
| `/dev research <topic>` | Research a library, framework, or integration with Context7 docs |
| `/dev mcp apply <profile>` | Configure integrations for a project |
| `/dev skill install <url>` | Install a community skill |

### Worktree Isolation (Automatic)

Commands that modify code — `/dev feature`, `/dev api`, `/dev debug`, `/dev refactor`, `/dev db` — automatically run inside a **git worktree**. This means:

- A new branch is created (e.g., `feature/user-auth`, `fix/login-crash`, `refactor/controllers`)
- All code changes happen in an isolated working directory
- Your main branch stays clean and untouched
- After the work is done, you can review it, create a PR, or merge

You don't need to do anything — the worktree is created automatically when you run the command.

### Real-World Examples

**Build a feature (full enterprise workflow):**
```
/dev feature "add user registration with email verification"
```
Paulo creates a TODO list, enters a worktree (`feature/user-registration`). Lucas researches Laravel auth docs. Gabriel designs the data flow and writes an ADR. Andre implements the backend (migration, model, service, controller). Diana builds the frontend (composable, component, page). Both self-critique their work. Bruno runs a security audit. Rita writes tests and enforces quality gates. Lucas saves patterns to the KB. Paulo writes the final report.

**Plan before building:**
```
/dev plan "payment system with Stripe"
```
Lucas researches Stripe integration options (Context7 + KB). Gabriel designs the architecture and writes an ADR. Paulo presents the plan with estimates. No code is written — run `/dev feature` afterward to implement.

**Run a security audit:**
```
/dev security-audit
```
Bruno runs OWASP Top 10 against your codebase. Lucas researches any CVEs found. You get a detailed report with severity, location, and fixes.

**Research before deciding:**
```
/dev research "payment gateways"
```
Lucas fetches docs, evaluates options (Stripe vs Paddle vs Cashier), checks your KB for prior decisions, and delivers a comparison report.

### Where Results Are Saved

- **Architecture decisions:** `Projects/<name>/Architecture/ADR-<NNN>.md`
- **Security audits:** `Projects/<name>/Architecture/Security-Audit-<date>.md`
- **Technical docs:** `Projects/<name>/Docs/`
- **Research:** `Projects/<name>/Docs/Research-<topic>.md`

## Strategy — `/strat`

### What This Department Does

The Strategy department helps you think bigger — market analysis, brainstorming, competitive intelligence, and strategic planning. Every analysis uses proven business frameworks and ends with concrete action items.

### The Team

**Tomas — Chief Strategist**
Ex-management consultant who thinks in frameworks — Porter's Five Forces, Blue Ocean Strategy, Jobs-to-be-Done. Tomas blends data with intuition, plays devil's advocate, and spots connections others miss. During brainstorms, he argues from 5 different perspectives (visionary, pragmatist, skeptic, customer, analyst) and then synthesizes everything into a clear recommendation.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/strat brainstorm <topic>` | Structured brainstorm with 5 simultaneous perspectives, then a synthesis with a clear recommendation |
| `/strat market <industry>` | Full market analysis — total addressable market, serviceable market, competitive landscape, entry barriers |
| `/strat prospect <criteria>` | Find and profile potential clients or partners |
| `/strat compete <competitor>` | Deep competitive intelligence — strengths, weaknesses, strategy, and where to attack |
| `/strat swot <business>` | Classic SWOT analysis with prioritized actions for each quadrant |
| `/strat evaluate <idea>` | Score a business idea on market size, feasibility, competition, and timing |
| `/strat pivot <context>` | Analyze strategic pivot options with risk and reward for each path |
| `/strat roadmap <product>` | Create a product or business roadmap with milestones and dependencies |
| `/strat trends <industry>` | Analyze emerging trends and predict where things are heading |

### Real-World Examples

**Brainstorm a new direction:**
```
/strat brainstorm "should we add a marketplace to our SaaS?"
```
Five perspectives argue simultaneously:
- **Visionary:** "The platform play is where the money is..."
- **Pragmatist:** "We need 1,000 active users before a marketplace makes sense..."
- **Devil's Advocate:** "Every SaaS that became a marketplace lost focus..."
- **Customer Voice:** "Users want integrations, not a marketplace..."
- **Analyst:** "The data shows marketplace SaaS has 3x higher retention..."

Then Tomas synthesizes it all into a clear recommendation.

**Analyze a market:**
```
/strat market "AI tools for real estate agents in Europe"
```
Get market sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM), key players, entry barriers, customer segments, and a go-to-market recommendation.

**Evaluate a competitor:**
```
/strat compete "Notion"
```
Get a full profile — their strengths, weaknesses, pricing strategy, target market, recent moves, and specific opportunities where you can differentiate.

### Where Results Are Saved

Strategy documents go to `WizardingCode/Strategy/` in your Obsidian vault.

## Knowledge Base — `/kb`

### What This Department Does

The Knowledge Base department turns content into usable expertise. Feed it a YouTube video, article, or any text, and it extracts strategies, frameworks, voice patterns, philosophy, and key quotes. Over time, you build a library of expert personas you can reference and generate content from.

### The Team

**Clara — Knowledge Curator**
Former research librarian turned AI knowledge architect. Clara is analytical, systematic, and quality-obsessed. She doesn't just summarize — she decomposes content into actionable frameworks, identifies voice patterns, and builds connections between different sources. Her rule: everything must be attributed, nothing is deleted (only merged), and contradictions between sources are valuable.

### What You Can Do

| Command | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `/kb learn <source>` | Learn from a YouTube video, article, or text — extracts expertise and builds a persona profile |
| `/kb search <query>` | Search across your entire knowledge base |
| `/kb persona list` | See all expert personas you've built |
| `/kb persona <name>` | View a persona's full profile — their strategies, frameworks, voice, and quotes |
| `/kb topic <name>` | View or create a topic page that links related knowledge |
| `/kb generate <persona> <topic>` | Generate new content written in a persona's authentic voice and style |

### Real-World Examples

**Learn from a YouTube video:**
```
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123"
```
Clara downloads the video, transcribes it, and runs 5 specialized analyses at the same time — extracting strategies, frameworks, voice patterns, philosophy, and key quotes. The result is a rich persona profile in your Obsidian vault.

**Generate content in a persona's style:**
```
/kb generate "Alex Hormozi" "pricing strategies for digital products"
```
Clara writes about pricing in Alex Hormozi's authentic voice, using his frameworks, examples, and communication style.

**Build expertise over time:**
```
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=video1"
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=video2"
/kb learn "https://youtube.com/watch?v=video3"
```
Each time you learn from the same person, their persona profile gets richer and more nuanced. The knowledge compounds.

### Where Results Are Saved

- Persona profiles → `Personas/` in your Obsidian vault
- Video sources → `Sources/Videos/`
- Article sources → `Sources/Articles/`
- Topic pages → `Topics/`
- Frameworks → `🧠 Knowledge Base/Frameworks/`
- Raw transcripts → `🧠 Knowledge Base/Raw Transcripts/`

---

## Working Across Departments

Departments aren't isolated — they share context and can reference each other's work. Some examples:

- **Marketing + Knowledge:** Luna can write content in any persona's voice after Clara has analyzed their content
- **Strategy + Finance:** Tomas can pull Helena's financial data into strategic analyses
- **Development + Operations:** Carlos can automate deployment notifications through Sofia's messaging channels
- **E-commerce + Marketing:** Ricardo and Luna can collaborate on product launch content

Everything flows through your Obsidian vault, so context is always available across departments.
