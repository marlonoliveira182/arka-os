> **Agent:** Ricardo (E-Commerce Director) | Requires: Browser integration (`/chrome`)

## Command

```
/ecom browse-competitor <url>
```

## What It Does

Navigates a competitor's e-commerce site and extracts structured competitive intelligence.

## Workflow

1. **Check browser availability** — follow [Browser Integration Pattern](/arka)
2. **Navigate** to the competitor homepage
3. **Extract** structured data:
   - Product categories and subcategories
   - Price ranges (min, max, average per category)
   - Current promotions and discounts
   - Layout patterns (grid, list, hero sections)
   - Navigation structure
   - Payment methods offered
   - Shipping information
4. **Capture screenshots** of:
   - Homepage
   - A product listing page
   - A product detail page
   - Cart page (if accessible)
   - Footer (payment/shipping badges)
5. **Generate report** in Obsidian with screenshots and structured findings

## Fallback (No Browser)

```
⚠ Browser not available. Using WebFetch for partial extraction.
For full competitor analysis with screenshots, enable: /chrome
```

Falls back to WebFetch/WebSearch for basic HTML extraction (no JS rendering, no screenshots, no interaction).

## Output

Obsidian report: `Projects/<ecosystem>/Strategy/Competitors/<domain>.md`
