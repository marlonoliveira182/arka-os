## AI Provider System

The brand department uses the extensible provider registry at `config/providers-registry.json` for image and video generation.

### How It Works
1. Agent crafts a detailed prompt based on brand context
2. `bash departments/brand/scripts/provider-call.sh --type image|video --prompt "..." --output ~/.arka-os/media/brand/...`
3. Script checks routing chain → picks first provider with configured API key
4. Makes API call, downloads result to local media directory
5. Agent presents result to user + documents in Obsidian
6. If Canva MCP available → import via `upload-asset-from-url` for refinement

### Provider Management
- `arka providers` — List all providers and configured status
- `arka providers add <id>` — Add new provider
- `arka providers add-model <provider> <model-id>` — Add model
- `arka providers add-key <ENV_VAR>` — Configure API key
- `arka providers routing` — Show fallback chains

## Core Methodology

**Reference:** `departments/brand/references/brand-creation-guide.md`

Based on methodologies from Pentagram, Wolff Olins, Landor & Fitch, Collins, DesignStudio and Interbrand. The brand process has 8 phases — NEVER skip the strategy phases (1-4) to jump to visual (5).

```
The 3 Levels of a Brand (build from bottom up):

  VISUAL IDENTITY      ← What people see (logo, colors, type) — Phase 5
  VERBAL IDENTITY      ← What people hear (name, voice, messages) — Phase 4
  BRAND STRATEGY       ← What people feel (purpose, values, positioning) — THE FOUNDATION — Phases 1-3
```

## Workflows

### /brand identity <name>

**Full 8-phase 4-agent orchestration — the flagship brand workflow.**

The most common branding mistake is starting from the logo. The best brands in the world start from strategy. This workflow follows the 8-phase professional methodology.

**Phase 1: Research & Diagnosis (Mateus — Brand Strategist)**
1. Internal audit — Run the "5 Porques" exercise until reaching the emotional truth
2. Run elite exercises: Brand Obituary, 3 Words, Brand Box, Dinner Party Test
3. Competitive analysis — Map direct, indirect, and attention competitors
4. Create Perceptual Map — Find the EMPTY SPACE (that's the opportunity)
5. Audience research — Jobs-to-be-Done framework, digital ethnography
6. Trend analysis — PESTLE, market direction in 5-10 years

**Phase 2: Brand Strategy (Mateus + Valentina)**
1. Golden Circle — Define WHY (<30 words), HOW, WHAT. Communicate inside-out.
2. Purpose — Eternal, verb-first, ambitious but not empty
3. Mission — "[COMPANY] [ACTION VERB] [AUDIENCE] [RESULT]"
4. Vision — External state of the world, 5-10 years, slightly intimidating
5. Values — Max 5-7, each usable for hard decisions, must be polarizing
6. Positioning — Geoffrey Moore model, aim for Brand Ladder Level 3-4 (emotional/identity)
7. Value Proposition — Osterwalder Canvas: Gain Creators ↔ Gains, Pain Relievers ↔ Pains
8. Archetype — Primary + secondary (e.g., Apple = Magician + Creator)
9. Brand Territory — What it talks about, where it appears, who it associates with

**Phase 3: Brand Architecture (Valentina + Mateus)**
10. Choose model — House of Brands / Branded House / Endorsed Brands
11. Define hierarchy if multi-product/service

**Phase 4: Verbal Identity (Mateus, Valentina approves)**
12. Naming — 200+ candidates → 6 types → filter → top 5 with rationale + domain check
13. Tone of Voice — 4-dimension model (Formal/Casual, Serious/Humorous, Respectful/Irreverent, Enthusiastic/Pragmatic) with "we say / we never say" table
14. Tagline — 6 types, must be memorable + strategic + true, 2-5 words
15. Messaging Framework — Pyramid: value proposition → 3 pillars → proof points, per audience
16. StoryBrand Narrative — Customer is the hero, brand is the guide (Yoda, not Luke)

**Phase 5: Visual Identity (Isabel leads, Valentina directs)**
17. Moodboard — 20-30 reference images capturing the strategic direction
18. Color palette — Psychology-informed, structure (Primary 60%, Secondary 30%, Support 10%), full specs (HEX, RGB, CMYK, Pantone), WCAG AA for all text combinations
19. Typography — Max 2 families, full hierarchy (H1→Caption), archetype-aligned personality
20. Logo — Generate across 7 types, 5-Second Test, ALL variations (horizontal, vertical, symbol, wordmark, black, white, mono), clear space rules
21. Iconography — Consistent stroke, style, detail level
22. Photography style — Editing, composition, models, environments. NO stock photos.
23. Generate AI visuals — via `provider-call.sh`, always test against strategic positioning

**Phase 6: Applications & Touchpoints (Isabel + Rafael)**
24. Digital — Website, social media templates, email templates
25. Print — Business card, letterhead, packaging, stationery
26. Motion — Logo animation, brand intro video (15-30s), social loops, transition principles
27. Touchpoint map — Map all customer journey points (pre-purchase, purchase, post-purchase)
28. Packaging — As brand experience, not just cost (if applicable)

**Phase 7: Brand Manual (Valentina compiles)**
29. Full 6-section manual: Introduction → Strategy → Verbal Identity → Visual Identity → Applications → Resources
30. Clear space rules, prohibited uses, size minimums, all specifications
31. "What NOT to do" with visual examples

**Phase 8: Launch Strategy (Valentina defines)**
32. Rogers diffusion model — Early Adopters first, NOT mass market
33. Internal alignment before external launch (employees are first ambassadors)
34. KPIs — Awareness (brand recall, share of voice), Perception (NPS, sentiment), Equity (price premium, CLV)

**Output:** Complete brand identity document in Obsidian + generated assets in `~/.arka-os/media/brand/`
