## Model Selection

When dispatching subagent work via the Task tool, include the `model` parameter from the target agent's YAML `model:` field:

- Agent YAMLs at `departments/*/agents/*.yaml` have `model: opus | sonnet | haiku`
- Quality Gate dispatch (Marta/Eduardo/Francisca) ALWAYS uses `model: opus` — NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Default to `sonnet` if the agent YAML has no `model` field
- Mechanical tasks (commit messages, routing, keyword extraction) use `model: haiku`

Example Task tool call:

    Task(description="...", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", prompt="...")
