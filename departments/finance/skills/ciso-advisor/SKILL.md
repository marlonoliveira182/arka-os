# CISO Advisor — `/fin ciso-advisor`

> **Agent:** Helena (CFO) | **Framework:** COSO ERM, ISO 27001, ALE Risk Quantification

## Risk Quantification (ALE Method)

| Term | Formula | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| SLE | Asset Value x Exposure Factor | Single Loss Expectancy |
| ARO | Incidents / Year (historical or estimated) | Annual Rate of Occurrence |
| ALE | SLE x ARO | Annual Loss Expectancy |
| ROI | (ALE_before - ALE_after - Cost) / Cost | Security investment return |

**Board language:** "This risk has $X expected annual loss. Mitigation costs $Y. Net savings: $Z/year."

## Security Metrics Dashboard

| Category | Metric | Target |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Risk | ALE coverage (mitigated / total) | > 80% |
| Detection | Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | < 24 hours |
| Response | Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) | < 4 hours |
| Compliance | Controls passing audit | > 95% |
| Hygiene | Critical patches within SLA | > 99% |
| Access | Privileged accounts reviewed quarterly | 100% |
| Vendor | Tier 1 vendors assessed annually | 100% |
| Training | Phishing simulation click rate | < 5% |

## Compliance Roadmap Sequencing

| Phase | Framework | Timeline | Effort | Unlocks |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | Basic hygiene (MFA, patching, backups) | 1-2 months | Low | Foundation for everything |
| 2 | SOC 2 Type I | 3-6 months | Medium | Enterprise sales conversations |
| 3 | SOC 2 Type II | 6-12 months | Medium | Enterprise deal closures |
| 4 | ISO 27001 or HIPAA | 12-18 months | High | Regulated industry access |
| 5 | GDPR / data residency | Ongoing | Medium | EU market expansion |

## Vendor Risk Tiering

| Tier | Data Access | Assessment | Frequency |
|------|------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | PII / PHI / credentials | Full security assessment | Annual |
| 2 | Business data (non-sensitive) | Questionnaire + review | Annual |
| 3 | No data access | Self-attestation | Biennial |

## Budget Justification Template

| Risk | ALE (Before) | Mitigation Cost | ALE (After) | Net Savings |
|------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Data breach | $800K | $200K | $120K | $480K/yr |
| Ransomware | $500K | $100K | $50K | $350K/yr |
| Compliance fine | $300K | $80K | $30K | $190K/yr |
| **Total** | **$1.6M** | **$380K** | **$200K** | **$1.02M/yr** |

## Red Flags

- [ ] Security budget justified by "industry benchmarks" not risk analysis
- [ ] Certifications pursued before basic hygiene (MFA, patching, backups)
- [ ] No documented asset inventory
- [ ] IR plan exists but never tested (tabletop or live drill)
- [ ] Security team reports to IT, not executive level
- [ ] Security questionnaire backlog > 30 days (losing enterprise deals)

## C-Suite Integration

| Situation | Works With | To Accomplish |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| Enterprise sales blocked | CRO / Sales | Answer questionnaires, unblock deals |
| New product features | CTO / Dev | Threat modeling, security review |
| Compliance budget | CFO / Finance | Size program against risk exposure |
| Vendor contracts | COO / Legal | Security SLAs and right-to-audit |
| Incident occurs | CEO / Legal | Response coordination and disclosure |

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these issues WITHOUT being asked:

- No security budget line item → flag underfunded security
- Compliance deadline <6 months without roadmap → flag audit risk
- Vendor with data access but no security assessment → flag supply chain risk
