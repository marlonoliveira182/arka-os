> **Agent:** Leonor (Financial Analyst) | **Framework:** 3-Statement Model + Scenario Analysis

## 3-Statement Structure

### Income Statement (P&L)
```
Revenue
- COGS
= Gross Profit (Gross Margin %)
- Operating Expenses (SG&A, R&D, Marketing)
= EBITDA (EBITDA Margin %)
- Depreciation & Amortization
= EBIT (Operating Margin %)
- Interest Expense
- Tax
= Net Income (Net Margin %)
```

### Balance Sheet
```
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Current Assets (Cash, AR, Inventory)
+ Fixed Assets (PP&E, Intangibles)
= Total Assets

Current Liabilities (AP, Short-term debt)
+ Long-term Debt
+ Shareholders' Equity (Retained Earnings)
= Total Liabilities + Equity
```

### Cash Flow Statement
```
Net Income
+ Depreciation (non-cash add-back)
+/- Working Capital changes
= Operating Cash Flow

- CAPEX
- Acquisitions
= Investing Cash Flow

+/- Debt raised/repaid
+/- Equity raised
- Dividends
= Financing Cash Flow

Net Cash Flow = Operating + Investing + Financing
Free Cash Flow = Operating CF - CAPEX
```
