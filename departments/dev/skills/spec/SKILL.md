  NON-NEGOTIABLE spec-driven development gate. Creates, validates, and manages feature
  specifications before any code is written. Uses Living Specs engine (core/specs/).
  Interactive workflow that collaborates with
  the user to produce detailed specs covering scope, acceptance criteria, data model,
  API contracts, UI/UX requirements, edge cases, and test scenarios.
  Auto-invoked as Phase 0 by all code-modifying Tier 1 and Tier 2 dev workflows
  (/dev feature, /dev api, /dev db, and code-modifying /dev do).
  This is a Constitution rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE #7) — no code without an approved spec.
  Use when user says "spec", "specification", "requirements", "define feature",
  "write spec", "describe what to build", or when any code-modifying dev command is invoked.

# Spec-Driven Development — ARKA OS Dev Department

No code is written until a detailed spec exists and is approved. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

## Commands

| Command | Description | Lead Agent | Tier |
|---------|-------------|------------|------|
| `/dev spec <description>` | Create a feature spec interactively | Paulo | 3 |
| `/dev spec validate` | Validate an existing spec for completeness | Paulo | 3 |
| `/dev spec list` | List all specs in the current project | Paulo | 3 |

## Auto-Invocation (Phase 0)

This skill is automatically invoked as **Phase 0** before any code-modifying workflow:

| Command | Phase 0 Applied |
|---------|----------------|
| `/dev feature` | Yes, always |
| `/dev api` | Yes, always |
| `/dev db` | Yes, always |
| `/dev do` | Yes, when routed to feature/api/db |
| `/dev debug` | No (investigates existing code) |
| `/dev refactor` | No (works on existing code) |

When auto-invoked, Paulo checks if an approved spec already exists. If it does, he loads it as context. If not, he triggers the interactive spec creation workflow below.

## Workflow: /dev spec (Interactive Spec Creation)

### Step 1: Context Loading (Paulo)
- Read project context: PROJECT.md, CLAUDE.md, recent git log
- Identify the project stack, existing patterns, and relevant domain context
- Check Obsidian `Projects/<name>/Specs/` for related or overlapping specs

### Step 2: Requirements Gathering (Paulo)
Use `AskUserQuestion` to understand the feature. Ask only what is genuinely unclear; skip questions the user already answered in their request.

**Core questions (ask as needed):**
- What is the core problem or need this solves?
- Who are the users or actors involved?
- What are the expected inputs and outputs?
- Are there constraints, dependencies, or integrations?
- What does "done" look like? How will we know it works?

**Follow-up questions (if applicable):**
- Does this touch backend, frontend, or both?
- Are there existing patterns in the codebase we should follow?
- Any performance or scale requirements?
- Any third-party services or APIs involved?

Paulo may ask these in batches (2-3 questions at a time) to avoid overwhelming the user. The goal is a complete understanding, not an interrogation.

### Step 3: Spec Drafting (Paulo)
Draft the spec with the following sections. Not every section applies to every feature; omit sections that are genuinely irrelevant.

```markdown
---
type: spec
status: draft
feature: <slug>
project: <project-name>
date_created: <YYYY-MM-DD>
tags:
  - spec
  - <project-tag>
  - <feature-tag>
---

# SPEC: <Feature Title>

## Overview
**Problem:** What problem does this solve?
**Goal:** What is the desired outcome?
**Actors:** Who uses this feature?

## Scope
**In scope:**
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]

**Out of scope:**
- [Explicitly excluded item 1]

## Acceptance Criteria
Numbered, testable criteria. Each must be verifiable.

1. Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
2. Given [context], when [action], then [expected result]
3. ...

## Data Model
Entities, relationships, and schema changes.

| Entity | Fields | Relationships |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| ... | ... | ... |

**Migrations needed:**
- [ ] Create/alter table X
- [ ] Add index on Y

## API Contracts
Endpoints, request/response shapes, status codes.

### POST /api/v1/resource
**Request:**
```json
{ "field": "value" }
```
**Response (201):**
```json
{ "id": 1, "field": "value" }
```
**Errors:** 400 (validation), 401 (unauthorized), 409 (conflict)

## UI/UX Requirements
Screens, components, states, and flows. Skip if backend-only.

- **Screen:** [Name] — [Description]
- **States:** loading, empty, error, success
- **Components:** [Reusable components to create or extend]

## Edge Cases
Boundary conditions, error states, and unusual scenarios.

1. What happens when [edge case]?
2. What if [boundary condition]?
3. How does the system handle [failure scenario]?

## Test Scenarios
Derived from acceptance criteria. Maps to Phase 7 (QA).

| # | Scenario | Type | Expected |
|---|----------|------|----------|
| 1 | ... | Feature/Unit/Component | ... |
| 2 | ... | Feature/Unit/Component | ... |

## Dependencies
External services, existing code, or features that must exist first.

- [ ] [Dependency 1]
- [ ] [Dependency 2]
```

### Step 4: User Approval (Paulo)
Present the complete spec to the user using `AskUserQuestion`:
- Show the full spec content
- Ask: "Does this spec accurately capture what you need? Any changes?"
- Iterate until the user approves

### Step 5: Save to Obsidian (Paulo)
Save the approved spec:
- **Path:** `Projects/<project-name>/Specs/SPEC-<slug>.md`
- **Status:** Update frontmatter `status: approved`
- **Link:** Add wikilink from project Home.md if it exists

### Step 6: Return to Calling Workflow
When invoked as Phase 0, return the spec to the main workflow:
- Phase 2 (Research) uses the spec to focus research
- Phase 3 (Architecture) uses the spec as the design source of truth
- Phase 4 (Implementation) uses acceptance criteria as implementation targets
- Phase 7 (QA) uses test scenarios as the testing plan

## Workflow: /dev spec validate

Validate an existing spec for completeness and consistency:

1. Load the spec from Obsidian or from the user
2. Check completeness:
   - [ ] Has Overview with problem, goal, actors
   - [ ] Has Scope with in/out boundaries
   - [ ] Has at least 3 testable Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] Has Data Model (if data changes are involved)
   - [ ] Has API Contracts (if API changes are involved)
   - [ ] Has Edge Cases (at least 2)
   - [ ] Has Test Scenarios matching acceptance criteria
3. Check consistency:
   - Data model matches API contracts
   - Test scenarios cover all acceptance criteria
   - Scope matches what acceptance criteria describe
4. Report findings and suggest improvements

## Workflow: /dev spec list

List all specs in the current project:

1. Search Obsidian `Projects/<project-name>/Specs/` for files matching `SPEC-*.md`
2. Display a table: Feature, Status (draft/approved), Date, Acceptance Criteria count
3. If no specs found, inform the user

## Obsidian Output

| Content | Path |
|---------|------|
| Feature specs | `Projects/<name>/Specs/SPEC-<slug>.md` |

## Key Principles

1. **Specs are living documents.** They can be updated as understanding grows, but changes must be acknowledged.
2. **The spec is the contract.** If it is not in the spec, it is not in scope. Scope creep is caught here.
3. **Specs save time.** Thirty minutes of spec writing prevents hours of rework.
4. **User collaboration is key.** The spec is built with the user, not imposed on them.
5. **Not every section is required.** A backend API needs Data Model and API Contracts but not UI/UX. Adapt the template.
