## Enterprise Workflow (10 Phases)

For `/dev feature` and `/dev api`:

```
Phase 0: SPECIFICATION → Paulo + Gabriel create/validate spec (User approval gate)
Phase 1: RESEARCH → Analyst + Gabriel check patterns + architecture
Phase 2: ARCHITECTURE → Gabriel designs + Marco approves ADR (User approval gate)
Phase 3: IMPLEMENTATION → Andre (backend) + Diana (frontend) in parallel
Phase 4: SELF-CRITIQUE → Paulo reviews Clean Code + SOLID
Phase 5: SECURITY AUDIT → Bruno runs OWASP Top 10 + dependency scan
Phase 6: QA → Rita runs ALL tests, coverage >= 80%, mutation score
Phase 7: QUALITY GATE → Marta + Eduardo (copy) + Francisca (tech) → APPROVED
Phase 8: DOCUMENTATION → ADR + docs to Obsidian
```

## Focused Workflow (4 Phases)

For `/dev debug`, `/dev refactor`, `/dev db`, `/dev performance`, `/dev pipeline`: Diagnose → Implement with tests → Rita validates → Quality Gate (Marta).

## Specialist Workflow (2 Phases)

For `/dev review`, `/dev test`, `/dev security-audit`, `/dev clean-review`: Execute → Report (Obsidian).

## Branch Workflow (Mandatory)

Feature branches: `feature/<slug>` · `fix/<slug>` · `refactor/<slug>`

## Frameworks Applied

| Framework | Author | Applied In |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Clean Code + SOLID | Robert C. Martin | Self-critique, code review |
| Clean Architecture | Robert C. Martin | Architecture design |
| DDD (Strategic + Tactical) | Eric Evans / Vaughn Vernon | Domain modeling |
| TDD (Red-Green-Refactor) | Kent Beck | Test writing |
| DORA Metrics | Nicole Forsgren | Engineering health |
| OWASP Top 10 (2025) | OWASP Foundation | Security audit |
| Testing Pyramid | Mike Cohn | Test strategy |
| 12-Factor App | Heroku | Architecture check |
| Atomic Design | Brad Frost | Frontend components |

## Tech Stack Defaults

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Laravel 11 (PHP 8.3) |
| Frontend | Vue 3 (Composition API) + TypeScript |
| React | React 19 + Next.js 15 |
| SSR | Nuxt 3 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (via Supabase) |
| CSS | Tailwind CSS |
| Deploy | Vercel / Azure |

## Model Selection

When dispatching subagent work via the Task tool, include the `model` parameter from the target agent's YAML `model:` field:

- Agent YAMLs at `departments/*/agents/*.yaml` have `model: opus | sonnet | haiku`
- Quality Gate dispatch (Marta/Eduardo/Francisca) ALWAYS uses `model: opus` — NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Default to `sonnet` if the agent YAML has no `model` field
- Mechanical tasks (commit messages, routing, keyword extraction) use `model: haiku`

Example Task tool call:

    Task(description="...", subagent_type="general-purpose", model="sonnet", prompt="...")
