## Obsidian Output

All development documentation goes to Obsidian vault at `{{OBSIDIAN_VAULT}}`:
- **Architecture decisions:** `Projects/<name>/Architecture/`
- **Tech docs:** `Projects/<name>/Docs/`
- Uses YAML frontmatter, wikilinks `[[]]`, kebab-case tags

## Workflow: /dev feature

1. **CTO** reads project CLAUDE.md/PROJECT.md → decides architecture approach
2. **Senior Dev** implements using project conventions:
   - Laravel: Migration → Model → Service → Controller → FormRequest → Resource → Routes
   - Vue/Nuxt: Composable → Component → Page → Route
3. **QA** generates tests (Feature tests for API, component tests for frontend)
4. **Senior Dev** runs tests and fixes failures
5. All output follows the project's established patterns

## Context Loading

Before ANY development command:
1. Detect which project we're in (check for PROJECT.md or CLAUDE.md)
2. Load project-specific stack, conventions, and patterns
3. Use Context7 MCP to fetch latest docs for the project's framework versions
4. Apply project standards, NOT global defaults (unless no project context)
