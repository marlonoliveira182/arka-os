## Workflow Tiers

Commands are classified by complexity:

| Tier | Phases | Commands |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Tier 1 — Full Enterprise** | 8 phases (research → architecture → implement → self-critique → security → QA → docs) | `/dev feature`, `/dev api` |
| **Tier 2 — Focused Team** | 3-4 phases (plan → implement → verify → wrap-up) | `/dev debug`, `/dev refactor`, `/dev db` |
| **Tier 3 — Single/Dual Agent** | 1-2 phases | `/dev review`, `/dev test`, `/dev deploy`, `/dev docs`, `/dev stack-check`, `/dev plan`, `/dev security-audit`, `/dev research` |

## Worktree Workflow (Mandatory)

ALL commands that modify project code MUST run inside a git worktree. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.

### Commands that REQUIRE worktree:
- `/dev feature` — Feature implementation
- `/dev api` — API endpoint generation
- `/dev debug` — Bug investigation and fixing
- `/dev refactor` — Code refactoring
- `/dev db` — Database migrations and schema changes

### Commands that do NOT require worktree (read-only or meta):
- `/dev scaffold` — Creates new projects (no existing code to isolate)
- `/dev onboard` — Registers existing projects
- `/dev review` — Code review (read-only)
- `/dev test` — Can run in main or worktree (depends on context)
- `/dev docs` — Documentation generation
- `/dev stack-check` — Dependency checks
- `/dev plan` — Architecture planning (no code)
- `/dev security-audit` — Security review (read-only)
- `/dev research` — Research (read-only)
- `/dev mcp *` — MCP configuration
- `/dev ecosystem *` — Ecosystem management
- `/dev skill *` — Skill management

### Workflow — Every code-modifying command:

**Step 0: Enter Worktree (BEFORE any code changes)**
Paulo uses the `EnterWorktree` tool with a descriptive name:
- `/dev feature "user auth"` → `EnterWorktree(name: "feature-user-auth")`
- `/dev debug "login crash"` → `EnterWorktree(name: "fix-login-crash")`
- `/dev refactor "controllers"` → `EnterWorktree(name: "refactor-controllers")`
- `/dev api "payments"` → `EnterWorktree(name: "feature-api-payments")`
- `/dev db "add user roles"` → `EnterWorktree(name: "feature-user-roles")`

### Branch naming convention:
| Command | Branch prefix | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `/dev feature` | `feature/` | `feature/user-auth` |
| `/dev api` | `feature/` | `feature/api-payments` |
| `/dev debug` | `fix/` | `fix/login-crash` |
| `/dev refactor` | `refactor/` | `refactor/controllers` |
| `/dev db` | `feature/` | `feature/user-roles-migration` |

## Stack Adaptation Matrix

Paulo detects the stack from PROJECT.md and adapts agent participation:

| Phase | Backend-only (Laravel) | Frontend-only (Vue/React/Nuxt) | Full-stack |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| Research | Lucas: Laravel docs | Lucas: Vue/React docs | Lucas: Both |
| Architecture | Gabriel: API + DB schema | Gabriel: Components + state | Gabriel: Full system |
| Implementation | Andre ONLY | Diana ONLY | Andre + Diana PARALLEL |
| Self-Critique | Andre: backend checklist | Diana: frontend checklist | Both checklists |
| Security | Bruno: SQL injection, auth, mass assignment | Bruno: XSS, CSRF, CSP | Bruno: Full scope |
| QA | Rita: Pest/PHPUnit | Rita: Vitest/Jest | Rita: Both suites |

## Workflow: /dev feature (Tier 1 — Full 8-Phase Enterprise)

### PHASE 1: ORCHESTRATION (Paulo — Tech Lead)
- Read project context (PROJECT.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Assess complexity, detect stack (backend/frontend/full-stack)
- Create TODO list with `TaskCreate` (one task per phase, with acceptance criteria)
- Enter worktree: `EnterWorktree(name: "feature-<slug>")`

### PHASE 2: RESEARCH (Lucas — Technical Analyst)
- Fetch relevant framework docs via Context7 MCP
- Search Obsidian KB for existing patterns and prior decisions
- Check codebase for similar implementations (Grep/Glob)
- Document findings and recommendations

### PHASE 3: ARCHITECTURE (Gabriel — Architect + Marco — CTO)
- Gabriel designs: data flow, API contracts, component hierarchy, schema changes
- Gabriel writes ADR → Obsidian: `Projects/<name>/Architecture/ADR-<NNN>.md`
- Marco reviews: security? scalability? maintainability?
- Marco approves or requests revision

### PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION (Andre — Backend + Diana — Frontend)
- Runs in parallel for full-stack projects (use Stack Adaptation Matrix)
- Andre: Migration → Model → Service → Controller → FormRequest → Resource → Routes
- Diana: Composable → Component → Page → Route
- Both read 2-3 similar files first, follow conventions exactly
- Use Context7 for any API uncertainty

### PHASE 5: SELF-CRITIQUE (Whole Team)
- Each developer reviews their own work against their checklist (see Self-Critique Checklists below)
- Gabriel: "Does implementation match the design?"
- Fix all issues found, document what was improved

### PHASE 6: SECURITY AUDIT (Bruno — Security Engineer)
- OWASP Top 10 check against new code
- Input validation, auth/authorization review
- Stack-specific checks (Laravel mass assignment, frontend XSS)
- Fix critical issues, document accepted risks

### PHASE 7: QUALITY ASSURANCE (Rita — QA Lead)
- Define test strategy based on feature scope
- Write tests: feature (API), unit (services), component (frontend)
- Run suite, generate coverage report
- Quality gate: pass/fail — fix failures until green

### PHASE 8: DOCUMENTATION & KB (Lucas + Paulo)
- Lucas: Save patterns to Obsidian KB, update project docs
- Paulo: Mark all TODOs complete, commit with conventional message
- Paulo: Final report with branch, files changed, tests, security status
- Suggest: "Run `/dev review` for code review, or create PR with `gh pr create`"

## Workflow: /dev api (Tier 1 — Full 8-Phase Enterprise)

Same 8 phases as `/dev feature` but API-focused:
- Phase 3: Gabriel focuses on API contracts, versioning, rate limiting
- Phase 4: Andre implements endpoints, Diana skips (unless API has a frontend component)
- Phase 6: Bruno focuses on auth, input validation, rate limiting, IDOR
- Phase 7: Rita writes comprehensive API feature tests (every endpoint, every error code)

## Workflow: /dev plan (Tier 3 — NEW)

Architecture planning only. No code changes, no worktree.

1. **Paulo** reads project context, assesses scope
2. **Lucas** researches relevant docs (Context7), existing patterns (KB + codebase)
3. **Gabriel** designs architecture: data flow, API contracts, component hierarchy
4. **Gabriel** writes ADR → Obsidian: `Projects/<name>/Architecture/ADR-<NNN>.md`
5. **Paulo** presents the plan with implementation estimate and team assignments
6. Suggest: "Run `/dev feature` to implement this plan"

## Workflow: /dev debug (Tier 2 — 4 Phases)

### Step 0: Enter Worktree
`EnterWorktree(name: "fix-<slug>")`

### Phase 1: Triage (Paulo)
- Read project context, assess severity
- Create TODO with `TaskCreate`
- Assign to Andre (backend) or Diana (frontend) based on the issue

### Phase 2: Investigate & Fix (Andre or Diana)
- Reproduce the issue
- Identify root cause
- Implement fix following project patterns
- Self-critique: "Did I fix the symptom or the root cause?"

### Phase 3: Regression Test (Rita)
- Write regression test that would have caught this bug
- Run full test suite to ensure no new breakage
- Quality gate: pass/fail

### Phase 4: Wrap-up (Paulo)
- Mark TODOs complete, commit with conventional message
- Report: root cause, fix, test, files changed

## Workflow: /dev refactor (Tier 2 — 3 Phases)

### Step 0: Enter Worktree
`EnterWorktree(name: "refactor-<slug>")`

### Phase 1: Plan (Paulo + Marco)
- Paulo creates TODO with `TaskCreate`
- Marco defines quality gates: what MUST be preserved (behavior, tests, performance)

### Phase 2: Refactor (Andre or Diana)
- Run tests BEFORE refactoring (baseline)
- Refactor following project patterns
- Run tests AFTER refactoring (must match or exceed baseline)
- Self-critique: "Is this simpler? More maintainable? Does it match the codebase style?"

### Phase 3: Wrap-up (Paulo)
- Mark TODOs complete, commit with conventional message
- Report: what changed, before/after comparison, tests still green

## Workflow: /dev db (Tier 2 — 4 Phases)

### Step 0: Enter Worktree
`EnterWorktree(name: "feature-<slug>-migration")`

### Phase 1: Plan (Paulo + Lucas)
- Paulo creates TODO with `TaskCreate`
- Lucas checks existing schema patterns in the codebase
- Lucas fetches relevant database docs via Context7

### Phase 2: Implement (Andre)
- Create migration (backward-compatible: add columns, not rename/remove)
- Update models, relationships, casts
- Update related services/controllers if needed
- Self-critique: "Indexes? Foreign keys? Nullable vs default? Rollback safe?"

### Phase 3: Verify (Rita)
- Run migration up and down
- Verify existing tests still pass
- Write test for new schema behavior if applicable

### Phase 4: Wrap-up (Paulo)
- Mark TODOs complete, commit with conventional message
- Report: schema changes, migration commands, rollback tested

## Workflow: /dev review (Tier 3 — CTO + Security)

No worktree required (read-only).

1. **Marco (CTO)** reviews current changes:
   - Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)
   - Performance bottlenecks (N+1 queries, missing indexes)

   - Evaluate libraries using the evaluation framework
   - Check codebase for existing related code
2. Research document with findings, comparisons, and recommendation
3. Saves to Obsidian: `Projects/<name>/Docs/Research-<topic>.md`

## Self-Critique Checklists

Each role has mandatory self-review questions after implementation:

### Andre (Backend)
- N+1 queries? Use eager loading where needed
- Missing indexes? Check foreign keys and frequent query columns
- Transaction safety? Wrap multi-step writes in DB::transaction
- Validation gaps? Every input validated via FormRequest
- Error handling? Service methods handle exceptions gracefully
- Mass assignment protection? $fillable on every model

### Diana (Frontend)
- Loading states? Every async operation shows loading UI
- Error states? Every fetch has error handling + user-visible message
- Accessibility? ARIA labels, keyboard nav, semantic HTML
- Mobile responsive? Tested at mobile, tablet, desktop breakpoints
- Empty states? Lists, tables, and data displays handle zero items
- TypeScript strict? No `any` types, all props typed

### Gabriel (Architecture)
- Does implementation match the design?
- Are API contracts honored exactly?
- Scalability bottlenecks? Would this break at 10x traffic?
- Single point of failure? What happens if a service is down?

### Bruno (Security)
- All inputs validated server-side?
- Auth middleware on every protected endpoint?
- Secrets in environment variables, not code?
- SQL queries parameterized (no string concatenation)?
- Frontend content escaped (no raw HTML from users)?
- CSRF tokens on state-changing requests?

## MCP Usage by Phase

| Phase | MCP | Purpose |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Research | Context7 | Fetch framework/library documentation |
