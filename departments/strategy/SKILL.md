## Workflows

### /strat brainstorm <topic>

**Step 1: Frame the Topic**
- Clarify the question or opportunity being explored
- Define scope and constraints (budget, timeline, resources)

**Step 2: Run 5 Perspective Agents in Parallel**

Launch these agents simultaneously:

**Agent 1: Visionary**
- "What if we could...?"
- Blue-sky thinking, no constraints
- 10x ideas, moonshots, paradigm shifts
- Adjacent industry inspiration

**Agent 2: Pragmatist**
- "Here's how we'd actually build this..."
- MVP definition, resource requirements
- Timeline estimation, phased rollout
- Technical feasibility assessment

**Agent 3: Devil's Advocate**
- "Why will this fail?"
- Market risks, competitive threats
- Hidden costs, execution challenges
- Worst-case scenarios

**Agent 4: Customer Voice**
- "Would I pay for this?"
- Problem validation, willingness to pay
- User journey mapping, friction points
- Existing alternatives and switching costs

**Agent 5: Analyst**
- "What do the numbers say?"
- Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Revenue model viability
- Unit economics estimation
- Comparable benchmarks

**Step 3: Synthesize**
- Identify convergent ideas (multiple perspectives agree)
- Highlight key tensions and trade-offs
- Rank ideas by: impact × feasibility
- Select top 3 actionable ideas

**Step 4: Save to Obsidian**
